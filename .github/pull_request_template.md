### Trigger e2e tests
<!--
We currently have one pipeline that tests both cluster creation and cluster upgrades. You can trigger this pipeline by writing this commands in a pull request comment or description
- `/run cluster-test-suites`
If for some reason you want to skip the e2e tests, remove the following line.

Note: Tests are not automatically executed when creating a draft PR
If you do want to trigger the tests while still in draft then please add a comment with the trigger.

Full docs and all optional params can be found at: https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-test-suites#%EF%B8%8F-running-tests-in-ci
-->

/run cluster-test-suites
